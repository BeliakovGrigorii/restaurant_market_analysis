The project aims to explore the restaurant market in Moscow as of summer 2022 to select the most profitable location and prices before opening a restaurant by the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fund. 

To achieve the project's goals, data preprocessing and analysis of data on addresses, average checks, categories, and ratings of establishments will be conducted. 

A detailed study of coffee shops will also be carried out, determining the distribution of ratings, districts, and the average cost of a cup of coffee. 

At the end of the project, a final conclusion will be drawn.

The data from Yandex Maps and Yandex Business will be used.
